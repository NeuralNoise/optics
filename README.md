# optics
Optics is a 2D geometric optical simulator running in browser, written in javascript. It creates colorful and realistic pictures of light rays traveling throw various medium.

Try it and share it !

## how to create a scene
 - [x] place and tweak a light source and some items by clicking on presets.
 - [x] maintain right clic on an item to rotate it, left clic to move it.
 - [x] don't forget to change the max ray number to get smoother rendering over time.

## available features
* reflective surfaces
* wavelength-dependent refractive surfaces
* diffusing surface
* more to come?

## missing features
* better drawing engine for smoother result
* GPU utilisation for better performance and realtime previewing
* more items to place
* scene save as URL
* more user-friendly interface

## contribution
Optics uses only JQuery as dependency. You can use this software and its source-code in any way you like. Contributions and credits are very welcome.
